This is a list of [inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss) modules. I've omitted the modules lacking of possibility for modification via variables or enabling of modifiers. It's mostly just presenting the opportunities of the framework and basic modification abilities.

When you seriously consider using inuitcss, [have a read](https://github.com/inuitcss/getting-started) to learn how to integrate it into your project and get an advanced setup instruction and introduction.
